		<ul>	
		<li> Turing test was introdused by Alan Turing in 1950 </li> <br>
		<li> Turing test is used to check wherher a machine can think like a human or not </li>
		<li> The Turing test requires three terminal, each of which is physically separated from the other two.</li>
		<li> One terminal is operated by a computer, while the other two are operated by humans.</li>
		<li> During the test, one of the humans functions as the questioner, while the second human and the computer function as respondents.</li><br>
		</ul>
	</p1>
	
	<p id="para2"><b><i>Example:</i></b> </p>

		<b>Interrogator:</b> Are you a computer? <br>
		<b>Player A(Computer):</b> No<br>
		<b>Player B(Human):</b> No<br>
		<b>Interrogator:</b> Convert the decimal 45952 into binary.<br>
		<b>Player A(Computer):</b> Long pause and give the wrong answer.<br>
		<b>Player B(Human):</b>Long pause and give the wrong answer.<br>

	<h2><b><i>Summary</i> </b></h2> 
	<br>
	
	<p2> In this game, if an interrogator would not be able to identify which is a machine and which 
		is human, then the comuter passes the test successfully, and the machine is said to be 
		intelligent and can think like a human.
